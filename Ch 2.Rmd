# Exercise: EDA

There are 31 datasets named `nyt1.csv`, `nyt2.csv`, ..., `nyt31.csv`, which you can find here: <https://github.com/oreillymedia/doing_data_science>.

Each one represents one (simulated day's worth of ads shown and clicks recorded on the *New York Times* home page in May 2012. Each row represents a single user. There are five columns: age, gender (0-female, 1=male), number impressions, number clicks, and logged-in.

You'll be using R to handle these data. Once you have the data loaded, it's time for some EDA:

```{r Load-Data}
library(tidyverse)

data.1 <- 
  read_csv("http://stat.columbia.edu/~rachel/datasets/nyt1.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
head(data.1)
```

1.  Create a new variable, `age_group`, that categorizes users as "\<18", "18-24", "25-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", and "65+".

    ```{r ex1}
    data.1 <- 
      data.1 %>% 
      mutate(age_group = case_when(age < 18 ~ "<18",
                                   age >= 18 & age < 25 ~ "18-24",
                                   age >= 25 & age < 35 ~ "25-34",
                                   age >= 35 & age < 45 ~ "35-44",
                                   age >= 45 & age < 55 ~ "45-54",
                                   age >= 55 & age < 65 ~ "55-64",
                                   age >= 65 ~ "65+"))
    head(data.1)
    ```

2.  For a single day:

-   Plot the distributions of number impressions and click-through-rate (CTR=# clicks/# impressions) for these six age categories.

```{r}
# impressions histogram
ggplot(data = data.1, aes(x = impressions)) +
  facet_wrap(~ age_group) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill  = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Impressions by Age Group",
       x = "Impressions") +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()

# impressions boxplot
ggplot(data = data.1, aes(x = age_group, y = impressions, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, color = "black", fill = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Impressions by Age Group",
       x = "Impressions",
       fill = "Age Group",) +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()

# click-through-rate density plot
data.1 %>% 
  mutate(ctr = clicks / impressions) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ctr)) +
  facet_wrap(~ age_group) +
  geom_density(fill  = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Cick-Through-Rate by Age Group",
       x = "Click-Through-Rate") +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()


data.1 %>% 
  mutate(ctr = clicks / impressions) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_group, y = ctr, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1, color = "black", fill = "white") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Impressions by Age Group",
       x = "Impressions",
       fill = "Age Group",) +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()
```

-   Define a new variable to segment or categorize users based on their click behavior.

```{r}
summary(data.1)

data.1 <- 
  data.1 %>% 
  mutate(click_type = case_when(
    impressions == 0 ~ "No Impressions",
    impressions > 0 & clicks == 0 ~ "Impression",
    clicks > 0 & impressions == 0 ~ "Clicks",
    impressions > 0 & clicks > 0 ~ "Impression & Click"),
    click_type = factor(click_type)
  )
summary(data.1$click_type)

head(data.1)
```

-   Explore the data and make visual and quantitative comparisons across user segments/demographics (\<18-year-old males verse \<18-year-old-females or logged-in versus not, for example).

```{r}
data.1 %>% 
  mutate(signed_in = factor(signed_in,
                            levels = c(0, 1), 
                            labels = c("Not Logged In", "Logged In"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = clicks)) +
  facet_wrap(~ signed_in) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "User Clicks by Logged In Status",
       x = "Clicks",
       y = "Count") +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()

ggplot(data = data.1, aes(x = clicks)) +
  facet_wrap(~ age_group) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "User Clicks by Age Group",
       x = "Clicks",
       y = "Count") +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()

data.1 %>% 
  mutate(signed_in = factor(signed_in,
                            levels = c(0, 1), 
                            labels = c("Not Logged In", "Logged In"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = clicks)) +
  facet_wrap(signed_in ~ age_group) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "User Clicks by Logged In Status and Age Group",
       x = "Clicks",
       y = "Count") +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()

data.1 %>% 
  mutate(gender = factor(gender,
                         levels = c(0, 1),
                         labels = c("Female", "Male")),
         signed_in = factor(signed_in,
                            levels = c(0, 1), 
                            labels = c("Not Logged In", "Logged In"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = clicks, color = age_group)) +
  facet_wrap(~ signed_in) +
  stat_summary(geom = "pointrange", position = "jitter") +
  labs(title = "User Clicks by Logged In Status and Age Group",
       x = "Clicks",
       y = "Mean",
       color = "Age Group:") +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()

data.1 %>% 
  mutate(gender = factor(gender,
                         levels = c(0, 1),
                         labels = c("Female", "Male")),
         signed_in = factor(signed_in,
                            levels = c(0, 1), 
                            labels = c("Not Logged In", "Logged In"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = click_type, y = clicks, color = age_group)) +
  facet_wrap(gender ~ signed_in) +
  stat_summary(geom = "pointrange", position = "jitter") +
  labs(title = "User Clicks by Logged In Status and Age Group",
       x = "Clicks",
       y = "Mean",
       color = "Age Group:") +
  ggpubr::theme_pubclean()
```

-   Create metrics/measurements/statistics that summarize the data. Examples of potential metrics include CTR, quantiles, mean, median, variance, and max, and these can be calculated across the various user segments. Be selective.

    ```{r}
    library(modelsummary)
    data.1 <- 
      data.1 %>% 
      mutate(gender = factor(gender,
                             levels = c(0, 1),
                             labels = c("Female", "Male")))

    datasummary((`Age` = age) + (`Impressions` = impressions) + (`Clicks` = clicks) + (`Signed-In` = signed_in) ~ gender * ((Mean = Mean) + (Std.Dev. = SD)),
                output = "markdown",
                data = data.1)

    datasummary((`Age` = age) + (`Impressions` = impressions) + (`Clicks` = clicks) + (`Signed-In` = signed_in) ~ gender * age_group * ((Mean = Mean) + (Std.Dev. = SD)),
                output = "markdown",
                data = data.1)
    ```

3.  Now extend your analysis across days. Visualize some metrics and distributions over time.
